## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It has a wide range of applications including predictive analytics, image recognition, and natural language processing.

### Steps to Do Machine Learning

To perform machine learning, follow these general steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: Understand the problem you're solving and gather the appropriate data.
2. **Prepare the Data**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature selection.
3. **Choose a Model**: Select an algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, K-Means clustering).
4. **Train the Model**: Use your training data to train the model.
5. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the model's performance using testing data.
6. **Deploy the Model**: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for use in production.

## K-Means Clustering

K-Means is a simple and widely used clustering algorithm that divides data into K distinct clusters based on similarity. It works by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

### Steps in K-Means Clustering

1. **Initialize**: Choose the number of clusters (K) and initialize the cluster centroids randomly.
2. **Assign**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on distance (Euclidean distance is typically used).
3. **Update**: Recalculate the centroids based on the mean of the points assigned to each centroid.
4. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer change or a set number of iterations is reached.

### Code Example

Here's an example of how K-Means clustering is implemented in Python using the `sklearn` library:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Example data
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)

# KMeans clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_)
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], marker='X', s=200, c='red')
plt.title('K-Means Clustering')
plt.show()
